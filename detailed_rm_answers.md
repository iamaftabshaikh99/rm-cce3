### **29. Explain Frequency Distribution and Cumulative Frequency Distribution.**

1. **Frequency Distribution:**
   - **Definition:** A summary of how often each value occurs in a dataset.
   - **Example:**
     - Dataset: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
     - Frequency: 1 occurs once, 2 occurs twice, 3 occurs three times.

2. **Cumulative Frequency Distribution:**
   - **Definition:** The running total of frequencies up to a certain value.
   - **Example:**
     - Dataset: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
     - Cumulative Frequency: 1 (1), 2 (3), 3 (6).

### **30. What is Measure of Central Tendency and Dispersion?**

1. **Central Tendency:**
   - Indicates the center point of a dataset.
   - **Measures:**
     - **Mean:** Arithmetic average.
     - **Median:** Middle value.
     - **Mode:** Most frequent value.

2. **Dispersion:**
   - Describes the spread of data around the central value.
   - **Measures:**
     - **Range:** Difference between highest and lowest values.
     - **Standard Deviation:** Average deviation from the mean.

### **31. What is Hypothesis Testing? How is Statistical Significance Determined?**

1. **Hypothesis Testing:**
   - A method to test assumptions about a population using sample data.
   - **Steps:**
     1. Formulate null (H₀) and alternative (H₁) hypotheses.
        - *Example:* H₀: A new drug has no effect; H₁: The drug improves health.
     2. Select a significance level (commonly 0.05).
     3. Perform the test and calculate the p-value.

2. **Statistical Significance:**
   - **Definition:** Indicates whether results are likely due to chance.
   - **Determination:**
     - If p-value < significance level (0.05), reject H₀ (results are significant).
